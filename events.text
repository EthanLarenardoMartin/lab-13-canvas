    For my events I originally had planned to use a drawing event for my welcome page. It would have different shapes bouncing around the canvas moderately fast (about 15 frames or so). I wanted to to this instead of my original plan of drawing a banner because I really liked messing around with velocity and the effect of the circle bounce in the labs this week. Along with the shapes in the canvas, I could also have my name in there too with fillText().
